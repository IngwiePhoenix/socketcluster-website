        <h1>API - SCSocket (Client)</h1>
        <p>
          Note that there are two types of SCSocket objects - One which runs on the client and another which runs on the server.
          These two objects have slightly different APIs. This page concerns the client socket.
        </p>
        <p>
          The client-side SCSocket object allows you to interact with your backend and with other client sockets in realtime.
        </p>

              The options argument is optional - If omitted, the socket will try to connect to the origin server on the current port.
