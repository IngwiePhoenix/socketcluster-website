        <h1>API - SCSocket (Client)</h1>
        <p>
          Note that there are two types of SCSocket objects - One which runs on the client and another which runs on the server.
          These two objects have slightly different APIs. This page concerns the client socket.
        </p>
        <p>
          The client-side SCSocket object allows you to interact with your backend and with other client sockets in realtime.
        </p>

              Note that you cannot emit any of the reserved SCSocket events.
              If a callback is provided, your server-side socket will need to respond to this event - <a href="#!/docs/handling-failure">See example</a>.

              The callback lets you check that the publish action reached the backend successfully.
              Callback function is in the form callback(err) - On success, the err argument will be undefined.
