        <h1>API - SCWorker</h1>
        <p>
          This instance is passed to your worker file's run() method.
          It represents your current worker.

        <table class="table">
          <tr>
            <td>id</td>
            <td>The id is an index - The first worker's id will always be 0.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>isLeader</td>
            <td>Boolean which indicates whether or not this worker is the leader (id == 0).</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>options</td>
            <td>The options object passed to this worker from master.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>httpServer</td>
            <td>
              The Node.js HTTP server associated with this worker.
              Note that this server's 'request' event will not trigger for requests which are handled internally by SocketCluster.
              If you would like to handle all requests (including ones for URLs reserved by SC), you will need to listen for the 'rawRequest' event.
              This is not recommended though unless you know what you're doing.

            <td>'exit'</td>
            <td>Happens when this worker exits (sometimes due to error).</td>
