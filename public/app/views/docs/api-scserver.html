        <h1>API - SCServer</h1>
        <p>
        This instance is returned from the call to worker.getSCServer().
        It represents your realtime (WebSocket) server object which you can use to listen for incoming realtime socket connections.
        This object inherits from engine.io's Server object so you have access to all the properties and methods of an engine.io server
        but with some additions.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Inherits from:</h3>

              For example, when you provide a callback to socket.emit() on the client (it will expect a response from the server).

            <p>
            Lets you add middleware functions which can be used to manage client access control to various features of the SCServer.
            This is useful for monitoring realtime data flows and also to block access to restricted channels and resources.
            Note that only actions from clients pass through middleware. Server-side calls to scServer.global.publish() do not.

                  reach the server.
