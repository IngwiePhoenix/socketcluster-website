        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>
          SocketCluster is a fast, highly scalable HTTP + realtime server engine which lets you build multi-process realtime servers that make use of all CPU cores on a machine/instance. It removes the limitations of having to run your Node.js server as a single thread and makes your backend resilient by automatically recovering from worker crashes and aggregating errors into a central log.
        </p>
        <p>
          SocketCluster works like a pub/sub system (which extends all the way to the browser) - It only delivers particular events to clients who actually need them. See this <a href="https://github.com/TopCloud/socketcluster/issues/6">issue</a> for some tips of how to leverage this feature. SocketCluster is designed to scale horizontally too.
        </p>
        <p>
          SocketCluster was designed to be modular so that you can run other frameworks like express on top of it (or build your own!)
        </p>
        <p>
          SocketCluster was designed to be lightweight and its realtime API is almost identical to Socket.io.

        <h2>Memory Leak Profile</h2>
        <p>
          SocketCluster has been tested for memory leaks. The last full memory profiling was done on SocketCluster v0.9.17 (Node.js v0.10.28) and included checks on load balancer, worker and store processes.
        </p>
        <p> 
          No memory leaks were detected when using the latest Node.js version. Note that leaks were found when using Node.js versions below v0.10.22 - This is probably the Node.js 'Walmart' memory leak - Not a SocketCluster issue.
        </p>

        <h2>Installation</h2>
        <p>There are two ways to install SocketCluster.</p>

        <h3>The easy way (Sets up boilerplate - Ready to run):</h3>
        <p>
          Setup the socketcluster command:
        </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint">npm install -g socketcluster</pre>
        <p>or</p>
        <pre class="prettyprint">sudo npm install -g socketcluster</pre>
        <p>Next step:</p>
        <pre class="prettyprint">socketcluster create myApp</pre>
        <p>Once it is installed, you can go to your myApp/ directory and launch the server with:</p>
        <pre class="prettyprint">node server</pre>
        <p>And the local host is now accessible at <code>http://localhost:8000/</code></p>
