        <h1>API - Store (nData)</h1>
        <p>
          The nData store object allows you to interact directly with SocketCluster's internal data and pub/sub channels.
          This object can be accessed from inside the storeController (store.js file by default).
          The store's main purpose is to allow you to synchronise SocketCluster's internal channels with external 
          channels from a third-party system - This is useful if you need to scale SocketCluster horizontally across
          multiple machines.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some third-party systems which can be used to achieve horizontal scalability include RabbitMQ, Redis (as a distributed cluster), 
          and various other AMQP and MQTT solutions.
          SocketCluster doesn't currently provide a plugin to do this automatically (there are plans for a Redis plugin) but, hopefully, this page is enough to give you an idea of how this can be achieved.
          Feel free to share your plugin with us if it's generic enough.
        </p>
        <p>
          When reading this documentation, it's important to keep in mind that your SocketCluster system could have multiple stores; in 
          such a case, each store will only manage a subset of all available channels (responsibilities will be somewhat evenly 
          distributed between each store).

              This is the options object provided through the storeOptions property when you initialize your SocketCluster instance (inside server.js).
              This can be useful if you need to pass command line arguments from your master process to your store when you run SC.

        <h3>Events:</h3>
        <table class="table">
          <tr>
            <td>'subscribe'</td>
            <td>
              This gets triggered whenever a SocketCluster worker subscribes to a channel. When a worker subscribes to a channel,
              it means that at least one client-side socket which is bound to that worker has asked to subscribe to that channel.
              A worker will not try to subscribe to the channel again if it is already subscribed to it.<br />
              <br />
              For the purpose of scaling SocketCluster across multiple machines, if you see this event triggered for a particular 
              channel, then you know that the current store is interested in that channel, so you can use an MQTT, AMQP, or Redis client
              of your choice to create a matching channel subscription on a remote Pub/Sub cluster - This allows you to extend the subscription
              to an external pub/sub service.
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>'unsubscribe'</td>
            <td>
              This event will get triggered when a worker unsubscribes from a channel on the current store.
              A worker will unsubscribe itself from a channel when it no longer has any client-side sockets which want to be subscribed to that channel.
              A worker will only unsubscribe to a channel if it is subscribed to it.<br />
              <br />
              Like the 'subscribe' event described above, you can use this event to unsubscribe your store process from a particular
              channel on a remote Pub/Sub cluster.
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>'publish'</td>
            <td>
              This event will be emitted whenever a worker publishes data to a particular channel on the current store.
              The worker may publish data to a channel on a store when one of its client-side sockets asks to publish to that channel or
              when you call worker.global.publish(...) from the worker process.
            </td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        
        <h3>Methods:</h3>
        <table class="table">
          <tr>
            <td>publish(channelName, data)</td>
            <td>
              Publish data (can be any valid JavaScript object/type) to channelName on the current store.
              <br />
              For the purpose of scaling to multiple SC instances, this method allows you to inject external 
              channel data (from your remote cluster) into relevant SocketCluster channels.
              <br />
              Because this method publishes data directly from the store itself, the store will not emit a 'publish' event - 
              The 'publish' event only gets emitted when a worker publishes data.
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>run(query)</td>
            <td>
              Execute a query function on the current store. See http://github.com/TopCloud/ndata for details.
