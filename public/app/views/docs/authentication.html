        <h1>Authentication</h1>
        <p>
          Before v1.3.0, authentication in SocketCluster revolved around sessions. Since v1.3.0, authentication is based on 
          <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-json-web-token-32">JSON Web Token (JWT)</a>. SC's auth token system was designed to 
          solve the following problems:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Allow the user to stay logged in if their connection crashes without having to enter their credentials again.
            This had to work with SC's auto-reconnect feature so that the user to make the reconnection as seamless as possible.
          </li>
          <li>
            Allow a user to be authenticated across all open browser tabs by logging in using only one of them. (Sharing an auth token
            between multiple browser tabs).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          An important design consideration for SC's authentication system was that it had to work with, but yet be fully independent 
          from specific database engines or underlying data (this includes user account information).
          To achieve this, SC had to introduce the notion of a JWT auth token.
        </p>
        <p>
          Simply put, an auth token is a custom Object which is signed, encrypted and sent to clients as part of an authentication (login) process.
          Because the data in the token is encrypted when provided to the client, the client cannot know what is inside, and more importantly, because 
          the data is signed, the client cannot modify it without invalidating the token.
          This means that if your socket on the server has a valid auth token attached to it 
          (see <a href="/#!/docs/api-scsocket-server">socket.getAuthToken()</a>), then you know that the client's token was signed by the server 
          and the data that you see inside it is therefore valid.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some important things to note about an auth token is that you should only give it to a client AFTER they have been successfully 
          authenticated and also it should be kept secret between the client and the server (not shared with any other client - Just like a session id).
          Auth tokens in SC can be used to store any kind of access-control information related to a specific user.
          Generally, it will suffice to create a simple token containing only the username data:
        </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint">{
  username: 'bob123'
}</pre>
      <p>
        
      </p>
